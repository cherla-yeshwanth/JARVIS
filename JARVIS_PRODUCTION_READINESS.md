# JARVIS Production Readiness Report

## Critical Inconsistencies & Errors

### main.py
- **Undefined Variables/Functions:**
  - `brain`, `memory`, `executor`, `tts`, `SESSION_ID`, `print_banner`, `ProactiveEngine`, etc. are referenced but not defined or imported.
- **Indentation Errors:**
  - Unexpected indentation and unindent errors throughout the file.
- **Improper Use of `nonlocal`:**
  - `nonlocal is_listening` used without a proper binding.
- **Variables Used Before Assignment:**
  - Multiple variables referenced before they are assigned.
- **Missing Function Definitions:**
  - Functions like `print_banner`, `ProactiveEngine` are referenced but not defined.

### speech_assistant.py
- **Missing Dependencies:**
  - `speech_recognition`, `gtts`, `pygame` are not installed or not found.

### Security & Safety
- **User Input Validation:**
  - No unsafe subprocess/file operations or race conditions detected, but user input should always be validated before executing commands or file operations.

## Actions Required
1. Fix all variable scoping, initialization, and imports in main.py.
2. Define or import all referenced functions and variables.
3. Install missing dependencies:
   - `pip install SpeechRecognition gtts pygame`
4. Review and validate all user input before passing to subprocess/file operations.

## Summary
JARVIS is **not ready for production** until all above inconsistencies are resolved. All errors must be fixed, missing dependencies installed, and user input validation implemented for safe and robust operation.
